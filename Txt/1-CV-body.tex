\section*{personal statement}

\par My passion for technology is rooted in my fascination of automatic execution of tasks, the ability to process vast amounts of data and perform calculations at great speeds. I am particularly interested in High Performance Computing and how computers can be optimized and scaled. 

\medskip

\par As technology continues to advance, I believe these areas will become even critical. They are the building blocks of future innovations in AI, data analytics, software development, and more. My goal is to be at the forefront of these developments, which is why I am committed to furthering my expertise in this field. To that end, I plan to pursue a European Masterâ€™s in High-Performance Computing during the 2025/26 academic year, where my goal is to deepen my knowledge and contribute to computer research and technology.
